# RNN GUI Manual
A User-Friendly Interface for Building and Training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

**Production Support:** As you move your RNN models into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## ðŸ¤” What is this?
This GUI application provides an intuitive interface for designing and training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). With this tool, users can easily create RNN models, adjust hyperparameters, and visualize the training process.

### Main Functions

* **Sequence Length**: Set the length of the input sequence.
* **Hidden Units**: Define the number of hidden units in the RNN model.
* **Train Model**: Train the RNN model using the specified sequence length and hidden units.
* **Loss Visualization**: Display the loss during training, helping users monitor the model's performance.

### How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the GUI application by executing `python rnn_gui.py`.
3. Interact with the GUI to set sequence length, hidden units, and train the RNN model.
4. Observe the loss visualization to monitor the training process.

### Environment Dependencies

* **Python**: The application is built using Python 3.x.
* **NumPy**: Required for numerical computations.
* **Tkinter**: Used for building the GUI interface.
